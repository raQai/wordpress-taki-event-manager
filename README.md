# TaKi Event Manager

This WordPress plugin relys on the
[BIWS CPT Builder plugin](https://github.com/raQai/wordpress-cpt-builder).

It uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to render events in a short code.

## Installation

To be able to display the event items, you will need to build this project
before uploading or upload the `public/build` folder after building.

```bash
cd TaKiEventManager
npm install
npm run-script build
```
